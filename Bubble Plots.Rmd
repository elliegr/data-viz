```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(corrplot)

```{r}
USairpollution <- tibble(USairpollution)
head(USairpollution)
```

To visualize multiple variables at once, we create a **bubble plot.** The specific plot below plots the average annual wind speed and average annual temperature for a city along with the number of manufacturing enterprises, and the SO2 content in the air (micrograms per cubic meter).
 
```{r, fig.align='center'}
USairpollution %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wind, y = temp, size = SO2, fill = manu)) +
        geom_point(alpha = 0.5, shape = 21, color = "black") +
        scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
        scale_fill_viridis(discrete = FALSE, option = "C") +
        ggtitle("Comparing SO2 Levels with Average Wind Speed, Temperature, \n and Manufacturing Plants") +
        xlab("Average Annual Wind Speed (mph)") + ylab("Average Annual Temperature (Fahrenheit)") +
        theme_minimal()
```
